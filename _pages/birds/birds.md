<h1>Sampling information</h1>

The ABMI began deploying autonomous recording units (ARU) in 2015 to capture the vocalizations of song-birds. These observations have been incorporated into the ABMI's species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate.
