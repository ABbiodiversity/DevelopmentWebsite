<h1>Sampling information</h1>

The ABMI began deploying autonomous recording units (ARU) in 2015 to capture the vocalizations of song-birds. However, ARUs are also able to capture vocalizing amphibians. These observations have been incorporated with supplementary databases (e.g., Dr. Erin Bayne's lab) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. The results presented here include data collected between 2015 and 2021
