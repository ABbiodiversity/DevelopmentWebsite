excerpt: "We are the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute's (ABMI) Science Centre. Each year we create hundreds of species habitat models that must be reviewed by taxonomic experts."

<h1>Review process</h1>

Mammals and birds are reviewed on an <b>opt in</b> basis, meaning that we only present results for species where we are confident in the models due to higher scrutiny for these species. Other groups are <b>opt out</b>, meaning that we do not present results for species where we are not confident.
