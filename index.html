excerpt: "We are the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute's (ABMI) Science Centre. Each year we create hundreds of species habitat models that must be reviewed by taxonomic experts."

In order to ensure the accuracy of information presented on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser, the Science Centre has created the Development Website. This website allows all staff at the ABMI and external experts to review our species habitat models before they are made public on the Biodiversity Browser. In addition, this website may host exploratory analyses as we are always seeking to improve the quality of our underlying models.

We have divided results into the taxonomic groups that we currently monitor:

<ol>
  <li>Birds (In development)</li>
  <li>Mammals (In development)</li>
  <li>Amphibians</li>
  <li>Vascular Plants</li>
  <li>Bryophytes</li>
  <li>Lichens</li>
  <li>Soil Mites</li>
  <li>Habitat Elements (In development)</li>
</ol>

For those who are familiar with the figures presented on the Biodiversity Browser, feel free to dive into the species results and submit comments through the comment box on each page. If you need a refresher about any of the images you find, you can find descriptions in the Review Process section.
