# Review process

Mammals and birds are reviewed on an _opt in_ basis, meaning that we only present
results for species where we are confident in the models due to higher scrutiny for these
species. Other groups are _opt out_, meaning that we do not present results for species
where we are not confident.

1. Organize results on the development website
2. Identify and notify internal and external reviewers
3. Conduct review (ClickUp, Google Form)
4. Finalize species lookup tables
5. Update dev website and package result for handoff (tabular outputs and maps).
