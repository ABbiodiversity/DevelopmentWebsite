# ABMI Science Centre Development Website

## Overview

The ABMI Biodiversity Browser is Alberta’s encyclopedia of life. Through this portal, we provide information on monitored species. Users can easily search for individual species of interest and see where they’ve been detected in the province, habitat association, impacts of human footprint, and maps of habitat suitability.

In order to ensure the accuracy of information presented on the Biodiversity Browser, the ABMI Science Centre has created the **Development Website**. This website allows all staff at the ABMI and external experts to review our species habitat models before they are made public on the Biodiversity Browser. In addition, this website may host exploratory analyses as we are always seeking to improve the quality of our underlying models.

## Caveats

All information presented here is considered to be in development and should not be used for any application. The underlying analyses, species taxonomy, and figures are subject to change at anytime. For users interested in using our data, please use either the **Biodiversity Browser** (https://beta.abmi.ca/biobrowser) or **allinone** GitHub repository (https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/allinone).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the ABMI staff, both past and present. Without our field staff, geospatial experts, taxonomists, ecologists, and software developers, we would not be able to perform this work.
